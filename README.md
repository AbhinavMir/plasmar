# ðŸŒŠ Plasmar
### A Solidity-flavoured EVM language with sprinklings of Rust and Python

At Warpspeed's Hackathon @ WeWork, Bangalore, I got into a conversation with the folks @ Harbor. This got me thinking - what could we improve from a syntax-perspective. So with present presented-EIPs and new standards considered, this document presents the idea of Plasmar. It's a measure twice, cut once situation, so once I've thought this out a decent amount, I'll start work. You can star and follow - or contribute via PRs and Issues.

Cheers,
